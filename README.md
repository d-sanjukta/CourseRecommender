## <B> <u>PROBLEM STATEMENT </b></u>

> <h3><b> Building a Personalized Course Recommendation System for Udemy and Coursera by Leveraging Web Scraping, Feature Engineering, and Exploratory Data Analysis. </b>

* Descripton: 

    In this project, web scraping techniques will be utilized to collect and preprocess data from Udemy and Coursera websites. The preprocessed data will undergo feature engineering to enhance its quality and informative value. Exploratory data analysis will then be performed to derive meaningful insights from the data. Finally, a personalized recommendation system will be developed that utilizes filtering and content-based approaches to recommend courses based on users' preferences and past engagement. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly platform that enhances course discovery and engagement on both Udemy and Coursera.
